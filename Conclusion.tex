\subsection{Empirical Validation}
This study presents persuasive empirical evidence supporting the presence of the double descent phenomenon in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) employed for the demanding task of detecting metastasis in breast cancer patients. The outcomes from the loss curves \ref{model 1} \ref{model 2} corroborate previous findings on double descent, underscoring the significance of adequate depth, over-parameterization, and comprehensive datasets in unveiling this captivating behavior.

\subsection{Impact of Complexity on Double Descent}
A link was identified between the clarity of the double descent curve and the complexity of the neural network, implying that as the model's intricacy escalates, the double descent phenomenon becomes more pronounced. This finding bolsters the notion that leveraging deeper and extensively over-parameterized models can improve performance \ref{model 2}, contrary to the prevalent belief that increasing complexity would result in diminishing returns.

\subsection{Determining Stopping Points}
Moreover, the results indicate that for less complex models, establishing stopping conditions within the traditional regime is sufficient, as these models frequently lack the ability to replicate the epoch-wise double descent curve. These early-stopping conditions maintain generalization in the model allowing for broader application in other datasets.

\subsection{Enhanced Comprehension}
This investigation contributes to a more profound understanding of the delicate interconnection between model complexity, generalization, and performance within the realm of medical image analysis. Gaining such insights is vital for optimizing neural network architectures in real-world applications, especially when addressing high-stakes tasks like detecting metastases in cancer patients. This research lays the foundation for future in-depth analysis and fine-tuning of the methodology, fostering a more robust comprehension of the double descent phenomenon and its implications across a variety of applications.
