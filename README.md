# 8p361 AI-Imaging-project submission
Group 7 BME TU/e 2022-2023. This repository is meant to house the 6 models used in observing the relation between model complexity and epoch-wise double descent following the project described [here](https://github.com/tueimage/8p361-project-imaging).
It is also used to track our overleaf progress!
## Warning!
Please make sure your computer is configured to run these with a GPU as training time can be quite long for some of these models.
